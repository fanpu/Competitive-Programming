# Competitive-Programming
This is my own personal repo to archive and access my code used for mrJudge.

# Usage of Competitive Programming Reference Sheet
I will make this reference sheet free to use for anyone who so requires it. I will be working and updating it regularly as I learn new algorithms or data structures which I believe to be relevant. 

# Plagiarism
Copying of my code without understanding it to get AC on the judge is strictly forbidden. If you wish to refer when you're stuck, please try and understand the logic behind the code and recode it yourself so that you can actually learn something.
